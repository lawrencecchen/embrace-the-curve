          <span>
            My name is Angela Huang, and I am the founder of Embrace the Curve,
            Inc! I am currently a high schooler and a scoliosis patient myself.
          </span>

        <Paragraph>
          I was diagnosed with scoliosis in middle school. At the beginning, my
          curve was moderate, but it has increased in degrees since. Ever since
          I was diagnosed with scoliosis, I needed to wear an orthopedic shoe
          lift to address my leg length discrepancy. Being a teen, it was very
          embarrassing to wear a heavily modified shoe on one foot with a very
          noticeable difference in height than the other. As some of you may
          relate, I had a pretty difficult time dealing with that reality along
          with the serious back pain caused by my condition. However, I have
          learned to embrace my physical difference/appearance and gained the
          inner strength to cope with pain/challenges. Now, I have a healthier
          attitude and more positive view. Even though I still face daily
          challenges, I want to share my experiences with those who may be
          facing similar difficulties and may find some encouragement and
          support in this journey.

            The mission of ETC is to increase and spread awareness about
            scoliosis among teens and to encourage positive self-image. ETC
            strives to promote a positive outlook on different body shapes and
            the acceptance of a curved spine.

            ETC will provide methods of coping with the negative effects of
            scoliosis and provide teens with ways to improve the decorative and
            functional aspects of orthopedic shoes to be more affordable.
